# Machine Learning Helper Functions

This is a collection of helper function I regularly use in my machine learning and deep learning projects.
Having them in this repo allows me to import them whenever I need them and avoid having to re-write them every time.

## How to import them into your own notebook:
1. First run the following command to fetch the helper_functions.py file alltogether.
`!wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mrdbourke/tensorflow-deep-learning/main/extras/helper_functions.py`

2. Once this is done, you can now import the function you need from the file as follows:
`from helper_functions import plot_loss_curves, walk_through_directory`
